Bank Churn Analysis Readme
Overview
This repository contains files related to the analysis of customer churn in a bank. The analysis involves preprocessing the data using label encoding, one-hot encoding, and dropping unnecessary information. The predictive modeling is performed using a Random Forest Classifier to predict the probability of a customer churning or not.

Files Included
random_forest_classifier.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete code for data preprocessing and the implementation of the Random Forest Classifier.
requirements.txt: File listing the required Python libraries and versions for running the Jupyter Notebook.
Getting Started
Follow these steps to replicate the analysis:

Clone the repository to your local machine.

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/bank-churn-analysis.git
cd bank-churn-analysis
Create a virtual environment and install the required dependencies.

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
Open the Jupyter Notebook bank_churn_analysis.ipynb in your preferred Jupyter environment.

Run the cells in the notebook sequentially to perform data preprocessing and train the Random Forest Classifier.

Data Preprocessing
The data preprocessing steps include:

Label encoding for converting categorical variables to numerical format.
One-hot encoding to handle categorical variables with more than two categories.
Dropping unnecessary information that does not contribute to the analysis.
Random Forest Classifier
The predictive modeling is implemented using a Random Forest Classifier. The model is trained on the preprocessed data to predict the probability of a customer churning or not.

Dataset
The original dataset used for this analysis can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e1/overview.
